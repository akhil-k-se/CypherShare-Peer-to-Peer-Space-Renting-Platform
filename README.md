> CypherShare is a decentralized, encrypted peer-to-peer file sharing and storage platform that lets users rent out their disk space and earn passive income.
> </span>

- 🔐 **AES-256 Encrypted**: Files are encrypted before leaving the renter’s device — ensuring privacy and security.
- 🌐 **Decentralized via IPFS**: Files are stored across providers, enabling redundancy and distributed access.
- 🤝 **Dual Roles**: Choose to be a **Renter** (upload & retrieve files securely) or a **Provider** (host encrypted files & earn rewards).
- ⚡ **Electron Agent**: A dedicated desktop agent allows Providers to manage file syncing and background tasks seamlessly.
- 🧬 **Modern MERN Stack**: Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js — optimized for performance and scalability.
